# Task 3
 
## Aim of this task :

To execute straight line motion. 

Learn about(Keep in Documentation)  :

The speed of any two motors are never the same even when rated at same rpm. This prevents the bot to move in exactly a straight line since the speeds are unequal.

Write an Arduino code to drive a bot in exactly straight line (consider incorporating incremental rotary encoders on the wheels). The code should be well commented. Assume pseudo declaration of pins.
