# Task 6

## Aim of the Task -

You might have ideas about maze solving and wall following. It needs real knowledge on algorithms for solving them. There are many types of algorithms, some of them are Graphs, DFS and BFS, shortest path algorithms(Dijkstra algorithm). Workout on how these are used in finding shortest path and on other algorithms used for the same cause. Revisit the concepts of Arrays and pointers as they play vital role in these algorithms. 

Go through the different resources on Internet, Google, YouTube, or any other source or website you feel authentic on how are those implemented on Arduino. 


Documentation -
There is no specified format for documenting this. Use your own convenient ways to keep your research work for the same. (It can be hand written also)
